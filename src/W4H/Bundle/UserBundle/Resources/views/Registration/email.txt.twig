Dear {{ user.firstName }} {{ user.lastName }}

In order to make easier the program management, we created a database with main information about any speaker, co-chair, responsible, etc. 
We put a first information (coming from what we already have) about you in the database.
Please could you go and check/complete this information by using the form available at:

http://program.www2012.org/user/profile/edit.

You will have to login with the following information:

Username: {{ user.username }}
Password: {{ user.mailPassword }}


You will be able to login on the program application web site with the same username/password for having a personalized view of the program
(when, where, for what, and how you are planned in the conference).

Thank you for your help and see you in Lyon!

All the best
Alain Mille (General Co-chair)
Luc Mariaux (Organization Co-Chair)
