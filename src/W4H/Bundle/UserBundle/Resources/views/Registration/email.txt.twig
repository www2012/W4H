Dear {{ user.firstName }} {{ user.lastName }}

In order to make easier the program management, we created a database with main information about any speaker, co-chair, responsible, etc. 
We put a first information (coming from what we already have) about you in the data base.
Please could you go and check/complete this information by using the form available at http://local.w4h/app_dev.php/user/profile/edit.

You will have to login with the email we used to send this message {{ user.username }} and with the generated password [{{ user.plainPassword }}]
you can change through the same form.

You will be able to login on the program application web site with the same login/passwd for having a personalized view of the program (when, where, for what, and how you are planned in the conference).

Thank you for your help and see you in Lyon!

All the best
Alain Mille (General Co-chair)
Luc Mariaux (Organization Co-Chair)
